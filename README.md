# FakeLoad
FakeLoad is an open-source Java Library which provides developers with a simple way of producing “fake loads” in their applications.

In development and testing there is sometimes a need to to put the software system under stress in order to test certain aspects of the system. For example, developers might want to test the rescaling behaviour of their application by simulating high CPU or memory load, test the precision of their monitoring infrastructure or just simply “simulate” some complex operation.
 
It is hereby necessary that the simulated load is not only constant, but also controllable and predictable by the developer in a way that allows precise analysis of the system’s behaviour under stress. Therefore the developer often finds himself writing specific “simulation code” instead of focusing on what’s best for his application.
 
This is where FakeLoad comes in. By providing an easy to use interface, it is now possible to simulate specific loads within your application when and where needed, enabling you to spend more time on what’s really important.
